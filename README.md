# Statistical-Analysis-of-EKG-GSR-and-Respiration-Features-for-Stress-Recognition-in-Automobile-Drive

This study presents a method for analyze physiological signals, Electrocardiogram (EKG), Skin Conductance (foot GSR) and Respiration, to extract features able to identify drivers’ stress level while driving using Matlab. The data used in this study come from an already existing database, called “Stress Recognition in Automobile Drivers”, in which physiological signals were acquired while the drivers followed a prescribed path specifically designed to make the drivers experience different levels of stress. Features were extracted from 5 minutes intervals during the rest, highway and city driving conditions and the most significant ones were selected through statistical analysis. The results indicate that the three best indicators for stress recognition are features coming from foot GSR and Respiration signals for which an accuracy up 94% is achieved. These findings could be managed for in-vehicle information systems to improve drivers’ safety and comfort.
